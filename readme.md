# Code Meetings

## Usage

- npm i
- go to the users folder
- create a "TS" file with your name
- import the solution factory class within the file you just mad
- initialize the class with your information, see example [here](./users/Rafa.ts)
- create a new solution by calling "createSolution" and exporting it, parameter 1:name of question, parameter 2: function with solution
- go to index.ts and import the solution you just created
- pass the tester your solution
- depending on whether you used quokka or node you may have to compile
- if you are using node to run just run "npm run test" from your terminal
- if the solution is valid you will see a message in the console as well as everyone will get an email with your solution.
- if the solution is invalid you will get an actual and an expected value

## TODO

- use FS to auto log solutions in the solutions folder

## Rules

- Solutions Must be submitted by the end date
- You may look at existing solutions do deliver your own.
- Testbed is set up for typescript, to see if your solution is correct
